/**
 * The purpose of a Binding is to indicate what type of hardware 'entity' a
 * specific Data's leaf Elements is actually bound to. All Data starts as being
 * Unbound (and the whole point of cloneType is to return an unbound version).
 * Then, specific API calls take a Data, and return a bound version (either by
 * binding the original model or cloneType then binding the clone). For example,
 * Reg[T<:Data](...) returns a T bound to RegBinding.
 *
 * It is considered invariant that all Elements of a single Data are bound to
 * the same concrete type of Binding.
 *
 * These bindings can be checked (e.g. checkSynthesizable) to make sure certain
 * operations are valid. For example, arithemetic operations or connections can
 * only be executed between synthesizable nodes. These checks are to avoid
 * undefined reference errors.
 *
 * Bindings can carry information about the particular element in the graph it
 * represents like:
 * - For ports (and unbound), the 'direction'
 * - For (relevant) synthesizable nodes, the enclosing Module
 *
 * TODO(twigg): Enrich the bindings to carry more information like the hosting
 * module (when applicable), direction (when applicable), literal info (when
 * applicable). Can ensure applicable data only stored on relevant nodes. e.g.
 * literal info on LitBinding, direction info on UnboundBinding and PortBinding,
 * etc.
 *
 * TODO(twigg): Currently, bindings only apply at the Element level and an
 * Aggregate is considered bound via its elements. May be appropriate to allow
 * Aggregates to be bound along with the Elements. However, certain literal and
 * port direction information doesn't quite make sense in aggregates. This would
 * elegantly handle the empty Vec or Record problem though.
 *
 * TODO(twigg): Binding is currently done via allElements. It may be more
 * elegant if this was instead done as a more explicit tree walk as that allows
 * for better errors.
