/** Recursive Function Namer overview
  *
  * In every function, creates a NamingContext object, which associates all vals with a string name
  * suffix, for example:
  *   val myValName = SomeStatement()
  * produces the entry in items:
  *   {ref of SomeStatement(), "myValName"}
  *
  * This is achieved with a macro transforming:
  *   val myValName = SomeStatement()
  * statements into a naming call:
  *   val myValName = context.name(SomeStatement(), "myValName")
  *
  * The context is created from a global dynamic context stack at the beginning of each function.
  * At the end of each function call, the completed context is added to its parent context and
  * associated with the return value (whose name at an enclosing function call will form the prefix
  * for all named objects).
  *
  * When the naming context prefix is given, it will name all of its items with the prefix and the
  * associated suffix name. Then, it will check its descendants for sub-contexts with references
  * matching the item reference, and if there is a match, it will (recursively) give the
  * sub-context a prefix of its current prefix plus the item reference suffix.
  *
  * Note that for Modules, the macro will insert a naming context prefix call with an empty prefix,
  * starting the recursive naming process.
