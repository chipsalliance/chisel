- Your job is to split all public APIs using implicit SourceInfo into separate Scala 2 and Scala 3 specific interfaces
- The list of files to consider is in: implicit-sourceinfo-public-methods.md
- Note that public methods don't count if they are within private or package private classes, objects, or traits
- Please do a separate commit per file being split.
- Scala 2-only code lives in src/main/scala-2 or core/src/main/scala-2
- Scala 3-only code lives in src/main/scala-3 or core/src/main/scala-3
- Shared code between Scala 2 and 3 lives in src/main/scala
- A good example to consider is src/main/scala/chisel3/ltl/LTL.scala
  - All public types are in src/main/scala, but methods are protected
  - public methods accepting implicit SourceInfo for Scala 2 are in src/main/scala-2/chisel3/ltl/LTLIntf.scala
  - public methods accepting using SourceInfo fr Scala 3 are in src/main/scala-3/chisel3/ltl/LTLIntf.scala
- For some files, split files in src/main/scala-2 and src/main/scala-3 may already exist, please reuse them if they do. If they don't please create them.
- Any time you are splitting public APIs, find a test to run, in src/test
- When you turn a function in src/main/scala or core/src/main/scala from public to protected, also move the ScalDoc on it to the new public methods you add in src/main/scala-2 and src/main/scala-3
