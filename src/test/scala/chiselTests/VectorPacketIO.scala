  * This test used to fail when assignment statements were

  * the creation of the val outs in VectorPacketIO
  *
  * NOTE: The problem does not exist now because the initialization
  * code has been removed from DeqIO and EnqIO
  *
  * IMPORTANT:  The canonical way to initialize a decoupled inteface is still being debated.
