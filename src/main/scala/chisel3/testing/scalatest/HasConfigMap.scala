/** A Scalatest test suite mix-in that provides access to command line options.
  *
  * This expose any keys/values passed using the `-D<key>=<value` command line
  * option to the test via a `Map`.
  *
  * For example, you can invoke Scalatest passing the `foo=bar` option like so:
  * {{{
  * ./mill 'chisel[2.13.16].test.testOnly' fooTest -Dfoo=bar
  * }}}
  *
  * Inside your test, if the `configMap` member function is accessed this will
  * return:
  * {{{
  * Map(foo -> bar)
  * }}}
  *
  * This is intended to be a building block of more complicated tests that want
  * to customize their execution via the command line.  It is advisable to use
  * this sparingly as tests are generally not intended to change when you run
  * them.
