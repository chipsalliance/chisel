NAME
  $(basename $0) - a lightweight tool for managing the CIRCT and LLVM sources included directly in this repository.

SYNOPSYS
  circt-helper update-circt <target-commit-ish> [--overwrite-local-changes]
  circt-helper check-metadata-consistency

DESCRIPTION
  circt-helper is effectively a lightweight version of \`git submodule\`, specifically for the CIRCT project. \`git submodule\` is inconvenient for a number of reasons, and specifically including the LLVM project as a submodule is problematic because it is so large (~800MB in .git and a ~1.7GB checkout). Using circt-helper to manage the submodule instead brings this down to ~60MB in .git and ~200MB on disk. This significantly improves checkout time and performance of common git operations such as \`git status\`, greatly benefitting the developer experience and CI performance. It is worth mentioning that using \`git subtree\` would be worse, with all of the downsides mentioned except perhaps increasing the size of the checkout (though in a fragile way) and it would mix all of LLVMs history in with this repository.
  Having the sources in-tree is also beneficial. This avoids developers needing to manage submodules independently via \`git submodule update --init --recursive\`, which is a common source of confusion and error. Also, this allows saving modifications to CIRCT and LLVM without requiring separate commits in the submodules (though this functionality should be used sparingly, and we should aggressively upstream any changes we need).
  circt-helper does this by updating the managed sources (stored in the main repo under "mlir/circt" and "mlir/llvm") and metadata (stored in "mlir/support/metadata"). The managed sources are isolated from the rest of the repository to create an "input" snapshot. This script then checks out the CIRCT repo to the commit specified by "mlir/support/metadata/circt.sha" (and updates its LLVM submodule to the appropriate commit), and creates a "source" snapshot of the state of the repository. It then does the same for the target commit-ish, creating a "target" snapshot (check-metadata-consistency uses the source commit as the target to validate the state of the repository is consistent). Finally, an "output" snapshot is created by copying the "target" snapshot, and applying the diff between the "source" and "input" snapshots. This "output" snapshot is then synced back into the main repository, the CIRCT sha written to "mlir/support/metadata/circt.sha", and the LLVM sha written to "mlir/support/metadata/llvm.sha". Diffs between the "target" and "output" snapshots are stored in "mlir/support/metadata/circt.diff" and "mlir/support/metadata/llvm.diff" for reference. These diffs can be used to enforce or track user changes to the managed sources.
  There are downsides to this approach, primarly that we have built our own bespoke mechanism which is not battle-tested by the wider community and may be unfamiliar to new developers. However, we believe that for this project the pros outweigh the cons. This script attempts to be as simple as possible (simplicity does not imply brevity, we want to avoid cleverness and check our assumptions frequently). We can also always fall back to submodules, with minimal impact developer experience.

TROUBLESHOOTING
  If you encounter issues with this script, you can try deleting "mlir/support/.checkout", and re-running the script. If issues still persist you can try manually saving any changes to managed source (for example, by making a copy of the "diff" files in "mlir/support/metadata), and running \`circt-helper update-circt <current sha> --overwrite-local-changes\`, and then re-applying your patch.

# The standard `diff` tool doesn't have the exact semantics we need, so instead we provide a wrapper called `diff_helper` which modifies the behavior in the following ways:
# - If a diff exists, `diff_helper` returns 0 whereas the standard `diff` tool would return 1 (which would cause a failure due to `set -e`)
# - The standard diff tools uses the arguments to label the files in the diff, so `diff_helper` takes an additional argument of which directory to operate in, so it can pass relative paths to `diff`
# - The standard diff tool includes file timestamps in the diff, which we don't want because they change every time `circt-helper` is run. `diff_helper` strips these out
