# Naming Cookbook

### I still have _T signals, can this be fixed?

See the next answer!

### I have so many wires with the same name, like `x`, `x_1` and `x_2`. How can I make them easier to understand?

Signals with `_T` names or names that Chisel has to uniquify
often are intermediate values generated within loops, function calls, or `when` predicates.
They can also be consumed by verification statements like `assert` or `prints`.
In these cases, the compiler plugin often can't find a good prefix for the generated
intermediate signals and can't name them at all or has to make up a unique name for them.

We recommend you manually insert calls to `prefix` to clarify these cases:

```scala mdoc:silent
import chisel3.experimental.prefix
class ExamplePrefix extends Module {

  Seq.tabulate{2} {i =>
    Seq.tabulate{2}{ j =>
      prefix(s"loop_${i}_${j}"){
        val x = WireInit((i*0x10+j).U(8.W))
        dontTouch(x)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```scala mdoc:verilog
ChiselStage.emitVerilog(new ExamplePrefix)
```
### How can I get better names for code generated by `when` clauses?

The `prefix` API can help with code inside `when` clauses:

```scala mdoc:silent
class ExampleWhenPrefix extends Module {

  val in = IO(Input(UInt(4.W)))
  val out = IO(Output(UInt(4.W)))

  out := DontCare

  Seq.tabulate{2}{ i =>
    val j = i + 1
    when (in === j.U) { prefix(s"clause_${j}"){
      val foo = Wire(UInt(4.W))
      foo := in +& j.U(4.W)
      out := foo
    }}
  }
}
```
```scala mdoc:verilog
ChiselStage.emitVerilog(new ExampleWhenPrefix)
```

### I still see _GEN signals, can this be fixed?

`_GEN` signals are usually generated from the FIRRTL compiler, rather than the Chisel library. We are working on
renaming these signals with more context-dependent names, but it is a work in progress. Thanks for caring!

### My module names are super unstable - I change one thing and Queue_1 becomes Queue_42. Help!

This is the infamous `Queue` instability problem. In general, these cases are best solved at the source - the module
itself! If you overwrite `desiredName` to include parameter information (see the
[explanation](../explanations/naming#set-a-module-name) for more info), then this can avoid this problem permanantly.
We've done this with some Chisel utilities with great results!

### I want to add some hardware or assertions, but each time I do all the signal names get bumped!

This is the classic "ECO" problem, and we provide descriptions in [explanation](../explanations/naming). In short,
we recommend wrapping all additional logic in a prefix scope, which enables a unique namespace. This should prevent
name collisions, which are what triggers all those annoying signal name bumps!

### I want to force a signal (or instance) name to something, how do I do that?

Use the `.suggestName` method, which is on all classes which subtype `Data`.

### How can I omit the prefix in certain parts of the code?

You can use the `noPrefix { ... }` to strip the prefix from all signals generated in that scope.

```scala mdoc
import chisel3.experimental.noPrefix

class ExampleNoPrefix extends Module {
  val in = IO(Input(UInt(2.W)))
  val out = IO(Output(UInt()))

  val add = noPrefix { in + in + in }

  out := add
}
```
```scala mdoc:verilog
ChiselStage.emitVerilog(new ExampleNoPrefix)
```

### I am still not getting the name I want. For example, inlining an instance changes my name!

In cases where a FIRRTL transform renames a signal/instance, you can use the `forcename` API:

```scala mdoc
import chisel3.util.experimental.{forceName, InlineInstance}

class WrapperExample extends Module {
  val in = IO(Input(UInt(3.W)))
  val out = IO(Output(UInt(3.W)))
  val inst = Module(new Wrapper)
  inst.in := in
  out := inst.out
}
class Wrapper extends Module with InlineInstance {
  val in = IO(Input(UInt(3.W)))
  val out = IO(Output(UInt(3.W)))
  val inst = Module(new MyLeaf)
  forceName(inst, "inst")
  inst.in := in
  out := inst.out
}
class MyLeaf extends Module {
  val in = IO(Input(UInt(3.W)))
  val out = IO(Output(UInt(3.W)))
  out := in
}
```
```scala mdoc:verilog
ChiselStage.emitVerilog(new WrapperExample)
```

This can be used to rename instances and non-aggregate typed signals.
