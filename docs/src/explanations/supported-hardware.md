# Supported Hardware

While Chisel focuses on binary logic, Chisel can support analog and tri-state wires with the `Analog` type - see [Datatypes in Chisel](data-types).

We focus on binary logic designs as they constitute the vast majority of designs in practice. Tri-state logic are poorly supported standard industry flows and require special/controlled hard macros in order to be done.
