The *best resource* to learn about Chisel is the [**online Chisel Bootcamp**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/freechipsproject/chisel-bootcamp/master). This runs in your browser and assumes no prior Scala knowledge. (You may also run this locally via the [backing chisel-bootcamp GitHub repository](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-bootcamp).)

When you're ready to build your own circuits in Chisel, **we recommend starting from the [Chisel Template](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-template) repository**, which provides a pre-configured project, example design, and testbench. Follow the [chisel-template readme](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-template) to get started.

The following additional resources and references may be useful:
