# Latch-Up 2025

Latch-Up is a conference dedicated to open-source silicon organized by the [FOSSi Foundation](https://fossi-foundation.org).
At Latch-Up 2025 in Santa Barbara, CA,
I presented a [Chisel Update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbQGQR4MLds), primarily focused on the recent [v7.0.0-RC1 release](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel/releases/tag/v7.0.0-RC1).
There were lots of other interesting talks, check out the full schedule which includes links to the recordings and slides for each talk: https://fossi-foundation.org/latch-up/2025.

Two talks in particular that I think might interest the Chisel community:
* Rachit Nigram's talk [High-Performance Hardware Design with Hardcaml](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzk_4rz23tE)--In this talk Rachit does a great job of helping explain the intuition of how one might build an eDSL (embedded domain specific language) like Chisel.
* Xiaoke Su's talk ["One Student One Chip" Initiative: Learn to Build RISC-V Chips from Scratch with MOOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-LbD8Vq16k)--This talk is about thousands of students learning hardware design; apparently over half of the students choose to use Chisel which is pretty cool.

Feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel/discussions) on Github or [chat with us](https://matrix.to/#/#chisel:matrix.org) on Matrix if you have any questions or thoughts about the talk.
