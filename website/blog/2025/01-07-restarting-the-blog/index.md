# Restarting the Blog

It's been many years since the Chisel project had a blog.  In the spirit of New
Year's resolutions (and more pragmatically as a means to better communicate with
the open source community about Chisel), the Chisel developers are restarting
the blog.

In the future look for posts by Chisel users and developers about new features,
the rationale behind existing features, and more communication about the broad
direction of Chisel.
