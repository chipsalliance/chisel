/** Indicates if this Record represents an "Opaque Type"
  *
  * Opaque types provide a mechanism for user-defined types
  * that do not impose any "boxing" overhead in the emitted FIRRTL and Verilog.
  * You can think about an opaque type Record as a box around
  * a single element that only exists at Chisel elaboration time.
  * Put another way, if this trait is mixed into a Record,
  * the Record may only contain a single element with an empty name
  * and there will be no `_` in the name for that element in the emitted Verilog.
  *
  * @see OpaqueTypeSpec in Chisel's tests for example usage and expected output
