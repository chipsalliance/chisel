[**Chisel**](https://www.chisel-lang.org) is a hardware design language that facilitates **advanced circuit generation and design reuse for both ASIC and FPGA digital logic designs**.
Chisel adds hardware construction primitives to the [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org) programming language, providing designers with the power of a modern programming language to write complex, parameterizable circuit generators that produce synthesizable Verilog.
This generator methodology enables the creation of re-usable components and libraries, such as the FIFO queue and arbiters in the [Chisel Standard Library](https://www.chisel-lang.org/api/latest/#chisel3.util.package), raising the level of abstraction in design while retaining fine-grained control.

For more information on the benefits of Chisel see: ["What benefits does Chisel offer over classic Hardware Description Languages?"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53007782/what-benefits-does-chisel-offer-over-classic-hardware-description-languages)

Chisel is powered by [FIRRTL (Flexible Intermediate Representation for RTL)](https://github.com/freechipsproject/firrtl), a hardware compiler framework that performs optimizations of Chisel-generated circuits and supports custom user-defined circuit transformations.

## What does Chisel code look like?

Consider an FIR filter that implements a convolution operation, as depicted in this block diagram:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freechipsproject/chisel3/master/docs/src/images/fir_filter.svg?sanitize=true" width="512" />

While Chisel provides similar base primitives as synthesizable Verilog, and *could* be used as such:

```scala
// 3-point moving average implemented in the style of a FIR filter
class MovingAverage3(bitWidth: Int) extends Module {
  val io = IO(new Bundle {
    val in = Input(UInt(bitWidth.W))
    val out = Output(UInt(bitWidth.W))
  })

  val z1 = RegNext(io.in)
  val z2 = RegNext(z1)

  io.out := (io.in * 1.U) + (z1 * 1.U) + (z2 * 1.U)
}
```

the power of Chisel comes from the ability to create generators, such as n FIR filter that is defined by the list of coefficients:
```scala
// Generalized FIR filter parameterized by the convolution coefficients
class FirFilter(bitWidth: Int, coeffs: Seq[UInt]) extends Module {
  val io = IO(new Bundle {
    val in = Input(UInt(bitWidth.W))
    val out = Output(UInt(bitWidth.W))
  })
  // Create the serial-in, parallel-out shift register
  val zs = Reg(Vec(coeffs.length, UInt(bitWidth.W)))
  zs(0) := io.in
  for (i <- 1 until coeffs.length) {
    zs(i) := zs(i-1)
  }

  // Do the multiplies
  val products = VecInit.tabulate(coeffs.length)(i => zs(i) * coeffs(i))

  // Sum up the products
  io.out := products.reduce(_ + _)
}
```

and use and re-use them across designs:
```scala
val movingAverage3Filter = Module(new FirFilter(8, Seq(1.U, 1.U, 1.U)))  // same 3-point moving average filter as before
val delayFilter = Module(new FirFilter(8, Seq(0.U, 1.U)))  // 1-cycle delay as a FIR filter
val triangleFilter = Module(new FirFilter(8, Seq(1.U, 2.U, 3.U, 2.U, 1.U)))  // 5-point FIR filter with a triangle impulse response
```

The above can be converted to Verilog using `ChiselStage`:
```scala
import chisel3.stage.{ChiselStage, ChiselGeneratorAnnotation}

(new chisel3.stage.ChiselStage).execute(
  Array("-X", "verilog"),
  Seq(ChiselGeneratorAnnotation(() => new FirFilter(8, Seq(1.U, 1.U, 1.U)))))
```

Alternatively, you may generate some Verilog directly for inspection:
```scala
val verilogString = (new chisel3.stage.ChiselStage).emitVerilog(new FirFilter(8, Seq(0.U, 1.U)))
println(verilogString)
```

## Getting Started

### Bootcamp Interactive Tutorial
The [**online Chisel Bootcamp**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/freechipsproject/chisel-bootcamp/master) is the recommended way to get started with and learn Chisel.
**No setup is required** (it runs in the browser), nor does it assume any prior knowledge of Scala.

The [**classic Chisel tutorial**](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-tutorial) contains small exercises and runs on your computer.

### Build Your Own Chisel Projects

See [the setup instructions](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3/blob/master/SETUP.md) for how to set up your environment to run Chisel locally.

When you're ready to build your own circuits in Chisel, **we recommend starting from the [Chisel Template](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-template) repository**, which provides a pre-configured project, example design, and testbench. Follow the [chisel-template readme](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-template) to get started.

If you insist on setting up your own project, the magic SBT lines are:
```scala
resolvers ++= Seq(
  Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots"),
  Resolver.sonatypeRepo("releases")
)
libraryDependencies += "edu.berkeley.cs" %% "chisel3" % "3.2-SNAPSHOT"
libraryDependencies += "edu.berkeley.cs" %% "chisel-testers2" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
```

### Design Verification

These simulation-based verification tools are available for Chisel:
- [**iotesters**](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-testers), specifically [PeekPokeTester](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-testers/wiki/Using%20the%20PeekPokeTester), provides constructs (`peek`, `poke`, `expect`) similar to a non-synthesizable Verilog testbench.
- [**testers2**](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-testers2) is an in-development replacement for PeekPokeTester, providing the same base constructs but with a streamlined interface and concurrency support with `fork` and `join`.

## Contributor Documentation
This section describes how to get started contributing to Chisel itself, including how to test your version locally against other projects that pull in Chisel using [sbt's managed dependencies](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Library-Dependencies.html).

### Compiling and Testing Chisel

First, clone and build the master branch of [FIRRTL](https://github.com/freechipsproject/firrtl) and [Treadle](https://github.com/freechipsproject/treadle), as the master branch of Chisel may depend on unreleased changes in those projects:

```
git clone https://github.com/freechipsproject/firrtl.git
git clone https://github.com/freechipsproject/treadle.git
pushd firrtl; sbt publishLocal; popd
pushd treadle; sbt publishLocal; popd
```

Clone and build the Chisel library:

```
git clone https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3.git
cd chisel3
sbt compile
```

If the compilation succeeded, you can then run the included unit tests by invoking:

```
sbt test
```

### Running Projects Against Local Chisel

To use the development version of Chisel (`master` branch), you will need to build from source and `publishLocal`.
The repository version can be found in the [build.sbt](build.sbt) file.
As of the time of writing it was:

```
version := "3.4-SNAPSHOT"
```

To publish your version of Chisel to the local Ivy (sbt's dependency manager) repository, run:

```
sbt publishLocal
```

The compiled version gets placed in `~/.ivy2/local/edu.berkeley.cs/`.
If you need to un-publish your local copy of Chisel, remove the directory generated in `~/.ivy2/local/edu.berkeley.cs/`.

In order to have your projects use this version of Chisel, you should update the `libraryDependencies` setting in your project's build.sbt file to:

```
libraryDependencies += "edu.berkeley.cs" %% "chisel3" % "3.4-SNAPSHOT"
```

### Building Chisel with FIRRTL in the same SBT Project

While we recommend using the library dependency approach as described above, it is possible to build Chisel and FIRRTL in a single SBT project.

**Caveats**
* This only works for the "main" configuration; you cannot build the Chisel tests this way because `treadle` is only supported as a library dependency.
* Do not `publishLocal` when building this way. The published artifact will be missing the FIRRTL dependency.

This works by using [sbt-sriracha](http://eed3si9n.com/hot-source-dependencies-using-sbt-sriracha), an SBT plugin for toggling between source and library dependencies.
It provides two JVM system properties that, when set, will tell SBT to include FIRRTL as a source project:
* `sbt.sourcemode` - when set to true, SBT will look for FIRRTL in the workspace
* `sbt.workspace` - sets the root directory of the workspace

Example use:
```bash
# From root of this repo
git clone git@github.com:freechipsproject/firrtl.git
sbt -Dsbt.sourcemode=true -Dsbt.workspace=$PWD
```

This is primarily useful for building projects that themselves want to include Chisel as a source dependency.
As an example, see [Rocket Chip](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip)

### Chisel3 Architecture Overview

The Chisel3 compiler consists of these main parts:

- **The frontend**, `chisel3.*`, which is the publicly visible "API" of Chisel
  and what is used in Chisel RTL. These just add data to the...
- **The Builder**, `chisel3.internal.Builder`, which maintains global state
  (like the currently open Module) and contains commands, generating...
- **The intermediate data structures**, `chisel3.firrtl.*`, which are
  syntactically very similar to Firrtl. Once the entire circuit has been
  elaborated, the top-level object (a `Circuit`) is then passed to...
- **The Firrtl emitter**, `chisel3.firrtl.Emitter`, which turns the
  intermediate data structures into a string that can be written out into a
  Firrtl file for further processing.

Also included is:
- **The standard library** of circuit generators, `chisel3.util.*`. These
  contain commonly used interfaces and constructors (like `Decoupled`, which
  wraps a signal with a ready-valid pair) as well as fully parameterizable
  circuit generators (like arbiters and multiplexors).
- **Chisel Stage**, `chisel3.stage.*`, which contains compilation and test
  functions that are invoked in the standard Verilog generation and simulation
  testing infrastructure. These can also be used as part of custom flows.

### Which version should I use?

The chisel eco-system (`chisel3`, `firttl`, `dsptools`, `firrtl-interpreter`, `treadle`, `diagrammer`) use a form of semantic versioning:
 major versions are identified by two leading numbers, separated by a dot (i.e., `3.2`), minor versions by a single number following the major version, separated by a dot.
 We maintain API compatibility within a major version (i.e., `3.2.12` should be API-compatible with `3.2.0`), but do not guarantee API compatibility between major versions
 (i.e., APIs may change between `3.1.8` and `3.2.0`).
 We may introduce new definitions or add additional parameters to existing definitions in a minor release, but we do our best to maintain compatibility with previous minor releases of a major release - code that worked in `3.2.0` should continue to work un-modified in `3.2.10`.

We encourage chisel users (rather than chisel developers), to use release versions of chisel.
 The chisel web site (and GitHub repository) should indicate the current release version.
 If you encounter an issue with a released version of chisel, please file an issue on GitHub mentioning the chisel version and provide a simple test case (if possible).
 Try to reproduce the issue with the associated latest minor release (to verify that the issue hasn't been addressed).

If you're developing a chisel library (or `chisel` itself), you'll probably want to work closer to the tip of the development trunk.
 By default, the master branches of the chisel repositories are configured to build and publish their version of the code as `Z.Y-SNAPSHOT`.
 We try to publish an updated SNAPSHOT every two weeks.
 There is no guarantee of API compatibility between SNAPSHOT versions, but we publish date-stamped `Z.Y-yyyymmdd-SNAPSHOT` versions which will not change.
 The code in `Z.Y-SNAPSHOT` should match the code in the most recent `Z.Y-yyyymmdd-SNAPSHOT` version, the differences being the chisel library dependencies:
 `Z.Y-SNAPSHOT`s depend on `V.U-SNAPSHOT`s and `Z.Y-yyyymmdd-SNAPSHOT`s will depend on `V.U-yyyymmdd-SNAPSHOT`s.
 **NOTE**: Prior to the `v3.2-20191030-SNAPSHOT` version, we used `Z.Y-mmddyy-SNAPSHOT` to tag and name published SNAPSHOTs.

If you're developing a library (or another chisel tool), you should probably work with date-stamped SNAPSHOTs until your library or tool is ready to be published (to ensure a consistent API).
 Prior to publishing, you should verify your code against generic (no date-stamp) SNAPSHOTs, or locally published clones of the current master branches of chisel dependencies.
