            <description><![CDATA[Chisel update talk at Latch Up 2025]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Latch-Up is a conference dedicated to open-source silicon organized by the <a href="https://fossi-foundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FOSSi Foundation</a>.
At Latch-Up 2025 in Santa Barbara, CA,
I presented a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbQGQR4MLds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chisel Update</a>, primarily focused on the recent <a href="https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel/releases/tag/v7.0.0-RC1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v7.0.0-RC1 release</a>.
There were lots of other interesting talks, check out the full schedule which includes links to the recordings and slides for each talk: <a href="https://fossi-foundation.org/latch-up/2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://fossi-foundation.org/latch-up/2025</a>.</p>
<p>Two talks in particular that I think might interest the Chisel community:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rachit Nigram's talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzk_4rz23tE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Performance Hardware Design with Hardcaml</a>--In this talk Rachit does a great job of helping explain the intuition of how one might build an eDSL (embedded domain specific language) like Chisel.</li>
<li>Xiaoke Su's talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-LbD8Vq16k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"One Student One Chip" Initiative: Learn to Build RISC-V Chips from Scratch with MOOC</a>--This talk is about thousands of students learning hardware design; apparently over half of the students choose to use Chisel which is pretty cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start a discussion</a> on Github or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#chisel:matrix.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chat with us</a> on Matrix if you have any questions or thoughts about the talk.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[After a long hiatus, the Chisel developers are restarting the Chisel blog.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been many years since the Chisel project had a blog.  In the spirit of New
Year's resolutions (and more pragmatically as a means to better communicate with
the open source community about Chisel), the Chisel developers are restarting
the blog.</p>
<p>In the future look for posts by Chisel users and developers about new features,
the rationale behind existing features, and more communication about the broad
direction of Chisel.</p>]]></content:encoded>
