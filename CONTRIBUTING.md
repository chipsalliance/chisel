## GUIDE TO CONTRIBUTING

1. If you need help on making a pull request, follow this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

2. To understand how to compile and test chisel3 from the source code, follow the instructions in [SETUP.md](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel3/blob/master/SETUP.md).

<!-- This ones helped me a lot -->

4. To introduce yourself and get help, you can join the [gitter](https://gitter.im/freechipsproject/chisel3) forum. If you have any questions or concerns, you can get help there.

5. You can peruse the [good-first-issues](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel3/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) for easy tasks to start with. Another easy thing to start with is doing your own pass of the [website](https://www.chisel-lang.org/chisel3/docs/introduction.html) looking for typos, pages missing their titles, etc. The sources for the website are [here](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel3/tree/master/docs).

6. Please make your PRs against the `master` branch. The project admins, when reviewing your PR, will decide which stable version (if any) your change should be backported to. The backports will be opened automatically on your behalf and you may need to do some cleanup, but focus first on your `master` PR.
